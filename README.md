# AI-Powered QA Web App

## Overview
This web application leverages advanced language models and vector stores to deliver instant, accurate answers to user queries. The core functionality involves a robust question-answering (QA) system that integrates Mistral for language understanding, Hugging Face Bge for embeddings, and Chroma for efficient document retrieval. The app is built using Flask and designed for seamless user interaction.

## Features
- Quick and accurate question-answering
- Utilizes Mistral language model for understanding
- Hugging Face Bge embeddings for contextual information
- Chroma vector stores for efficient document retrieval
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- langchain library (included)
- Mistral model (pre-trained, specify the path)
- Hugging Face Bge model (pre-trained, specify the model name)
- Chroma vector stores (pre-built, specify the path)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-powered-qa-web-app.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Specify the path for the Mistral model, model name for Hugging Face Bge, and the path for Chroma vector stores in the appropriate sections of the code.
